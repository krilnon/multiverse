### Crowd Algorithms on Existing Interfaces

Started in June 2011, Multiverse is an application and research project designed to let people leverage existing desktop applications in crowd programming workflows.  It works by letting Mechanical Turk workers control clones of a virtual machine running the application(s) needed to generate the desired output by synthesizing worker contributions.
